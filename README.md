Enhancing Loan Portfolio Insights with Data
As a Junior Data Analyst, I developed a Bank Loan Report Dashboard using Tableau and SQL to help financial institutions monitor loan performance and risk. This project provided key insights into loan approvals, defaults, and customer trends.

📊 Key Features & Insights:

✅ Loan Approval & Rejection Trends – Analyzed approval rates based on credit scores, income, and loan types.

🏦 Loan Portfolio Breakdown – Visualized active loans by category (home, auto, personal, business).

📊 Customer Demographics & Credit Score Trends – Evaluated borrower profiles to refine lending strategies.

🔹 Tech Stack & Deliverables:

✔ SQL Queries – Extracted, cleaned, and transformed loan data from databases.

✔ Tableau Dashboards – Created interactive visualizations with real-time filtering.

By integrating SQL for data processing and Tableau for visualization, I provided clear and actionable insights to optimize loan management strategies.
